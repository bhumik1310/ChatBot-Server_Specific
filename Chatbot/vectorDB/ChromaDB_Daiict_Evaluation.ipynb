The pedagogy of ICT discipline should make a well-integration of Information Technology, Communication Technology, Electronics Engineering and Social Sciences courses, which a student cannot be trained in conventional Computer Science and Engineering or Electronics and Communication Engineering alone. The curriculum review process, started in July 2015, went through intensive interactions amongst specialized groups of faculty, formal meetings with faculty at large, discussion with external experts and multiple rounds of brain storming within the BTCRC. The entire exercise has been lasting close to a year. Structurally there is no major change in the revised curriculum. The curriculum is broadly classified into 3 categories of courses. The first category, referred to as Foundation, is a set of compulsory courses required to be taken by every student in the program. The next one is formed by a set of courses, referred to as the Electives, which adds to both the technical strength and humanities and social science skills of the program. The third one is composed of internships and BTech project (BTP). The curriculum provides students a multi- track option, where a student can acquire knowledge in breadth as well as depth in multiple tracks through an appropriate choice of elective courses, where electives could be in the four forms: ICT, Technical, Science and Open. The ICT electives provide expertise in courses which have components of computer systems and communication tracks; the Technical electives primarily provide expertise in some particular track; the Science electives provide expertise in basic sciences; and the Open electives belong to humanities, social sciences and management courses. Like previous curriculum structure, the revised curriculum has provision of mandatory rural internship and research/industrial internship. The student is also required to take at least a semester long BTech project (BTP) between 7th and 8th semester. The curriculum accommodates 175 credits, out of which 152 credits for courses and 23 credits for internships and project work. Out of the 152 required coursework credits, 111 credits are allocated to compulsory courses', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/daiict_webCrawl self data with chromadb private gpt/web crawl_DAIICT/docs/daiict.ac.in/daiict.ac.in_sites_default_files_Annexure_II.pdf.pdf'}),\n",

Finally, a student is required to take at least a semester long BTech Project (BTP) during which the students demonstrate their ability in using the knowledge and skills acquired during the program. The semester-wise structure of the curriculum is as follows: The course structure of the curriculum is broadly classified into 3 categories. Foundation Courses These are a set of compulsory/core courses required to be taken by every student enrolled in the program. Majority of foundation courses are offered in the first five semesters. These courses are from the technical areas of Computer Science and Information Technology (8 courses), Electronics and Communication (8 courses), as well as courses in Humanities and Social Sciences (4 courses), Mathematics and Basic Sciences (8 courses). A student earns 111 credits from these 28 Foundation courses. MnC Electives Courses Courses of this category add to both the technical strength and humanities and social science skills of the students belonging to this program. The curriculum provides students a multi-track option, where a student can acquire knowledge in breadth as well as depth in multiple tracks through an appropriate choice of elective courses. A student is expected to earn 41 credits from these types of electives. Internships and BTech project (BTP) A unique feature of the programs is the mandatory rural internship, which is expected to give the student a feel of his/her social milieu and is typically carried out with an NGO working in/for a rural setup. Its duration is of 3-4 weeks in the winter vacation falling after 3rd semester. After the completion of foundation courses, the student is required to take a 6-8 week Industrial/Research Internship. The student has a choice of taking an industrial internship or a research internship depending on his/her career goals. It is scheduled in the summer vacation falling after 6thsemester. Finally, the student is required to take a B.Tech. Project, during which he/she is required to demonstrate his/her ability to learn current areas of research and/or industrial interest, his/her ability to utilize the topics he/she has learnt during his/her stint in the program and his/her creative and design abilities.

(Honours) in ICT with minor in Robotics and Autonomous Systems ICT embodies the convergence of Computer and Communication systems and has obtained wide acceptance as a distinct discipline. It is also expected that ICT graduates would enjoy a special niche only if they have certain performance capabilities not found in conventional CSE and/or ECE graduates. Logically this convergence takes place at the systems level, but at the same time it is necessary to accept a certain level of granularity as one goes down to the level of circuits, devices and materials. All programs are designed to operate on a semester-based framework that follows choice-based credit system. The B.Tech. (ICT) program provides a lot of flexibility and choice to students. Students may choose to do more coursework and graduate with (a) B.Tech. (Honours) in ICT Apart from satisfying all credit/course/internship/project requirements stipulated for the B.Tech.

Furthermore, the curriculum of UG and PG programmes involves innovative strands from Humanities and Social Science courses, namely, Cultural Studies, Art and Science Fiction, Management, Finance, Economics and Environment, Animation, Film, Design, Graphic Design and Multimedia systems. curricula of The curriculum offers opportunity to all students to pick-and-choose courses that stimulate their intellectual capital and challenge their innovative strengths from the basket of elective courses of all sorts, technical (focused towards the state-of-the-art and their 15 UGC Proforma for Inspection professional career-oriented), science (explorative and investigative) and open (societal, indirectly thought provoking, sensitive) elective courses. Many courses are taught in a modular form, where one module finishes and the assessment of the students is completed, and then the next module starts. In particular, the courses in humanities and social sciences, design projects, communication skills follow modular approach. For details on curriculum design refer Annexure VI. 5.5 Has the University conducted an academic audit? If yes, please give details regarding frequency and its usage. Academic Council (AC) and Board of Studies (BoS) are two statutory bodies of the institute who monitor the academic growth periodically. The academic progression of all programs of DAIICT is conducted continuously through discussions in the Under Graduate (UG) and Post Graduate (PG) Programme Committees of the institute. Ideas and suggestions arising out of such deliberations are minuted and brought before the Board of Studies (BoS) and Academic Council (AC) for further consideration. Based on the approval from BoS and AC, any course curriculum may undergo changes vis a vis its content, mode of delivery, inclusion of practical components, method of evaluation etc. Meeting of the BoS and AC are organized at least once in each semester. The Institute has constituted its Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) which assesses academic performance of the institute and suggests appropriate modifications. IQAC is supposed to look after the appropriateness of the infrastructure for smooth running of the institute. Any modification suggested by IQAC is implemented by the offices of Dean-AP and the Registrar. 5.6 Apart from classroom instruction, what are the other avenues of learning provided for the students? (Example: Projects, Internships, Field trainings, Seminars etc.) The curriculum at DA-IICT is a blend of technology, basic science, humanities, social sciences, language and mathematics. The rigour at which these courses are dealt with is quite holistic and aims towards moulding our graduates with capabilities which can fit them in any challenging career pathway. Being the premier ICT institute in the country, the Institute is very proactive in incorporating the new techniques of e-learning resources in the academic practices. Our Resource Centre has a rich collection of e-resources – National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL) lectures materials, e- journals of all leading publishers, special lecture series on various ICT domains archived in DVD/CD, and communication language materials. 16 UGC Proforma for Inspection Most of the laboratory courses use extensively open source tools and e-resources of other forms in the respective courses, based on the concerned course instructor’s course policy. The course content and lecture materials of all courses are posted on respective faculty’s folder on institute’s intranet. Many of our students use e-books and enrol in online courses, e.g., MOOC, Coursera. Besides, students are also encouraged to participate in national/international level online contest such as programming ACM ICPC, Microsoft Imagine Cup, IBM TGMC, Google summer of code, etc, by which they get useful exposure and visualize on how one can make the effective use of e-resources from classroom learning to real-world practice.
