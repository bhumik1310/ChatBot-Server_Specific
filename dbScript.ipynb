Our own graduates who started their own company – Alma Connect is helping DA-IICT to reconnect the alumni with their Alma Mater by providing campus updates through the web portal (https://daiict.almaconnect.com/). As part of its ongoing commitment to reach, engage and connect to its graduates, the DA-IICT Alumni Association organizes Alumni Day at the Institute every year. The announcement of the Alumni Day is carried on various online channels including Almaconnect, Facebook, Google, alumni group etc. This is followed up by personal invites to those who indicate a strong interest in attending the event. The programme is usually held in two parts. The first is an interaction between the faculty and the alumni in the morning and the second is an interaction between the alumni and current students in the evening. It is proposed to establish an Alumni Account to which an alumni can contribute; this fund can be utilized to support the travel of the students to attend national/international conferences to present their research papers. Recently, alumni’s help has been sought for assisting the students in summer internships. Apart from the yearly meet at the campus, the alumni activities also take place at various cities in India including NCR, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad and in the USA (Boston). These city-wise chapters regularly arrange a meet to discuss the activities of Alumni Association and to discuss in what all possible way the alums can help the institute and the present students.
